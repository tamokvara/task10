    <p class="p1">It is a long established fact that a reader will be <br> 
        distracted by the readable content of a page <br> 
        when looking at its layout. The point of using <br> 
        Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal<br> 
        distribution of letters, as opposed to using <br> 
        'Content here, content here', making it look like <br> 
        readable English. Many desktop publishing <br> 
        packages and web page editors now use Lorem <br> 
        Ipsum as their default model text, and a search <br> 
        for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still <br> 
        in their infancy. Various versions have evolved <br> 
        over the years, sometimes by accident, <br> 
        sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the <br> 
        like).
